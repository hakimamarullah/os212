Virtual filesystems are the magic abstraction that makes the **"everything is a file"** philosophy of Linux possible.

### W04
1. [Brief of Address Binding](https://www.i2tutorials.com/os-introduction/os-address-binding/)<br>
Address binding helps allocate a physical memory location to a logical pointer by associating a physical address to the logical address or the virtual address.

2. [Difference between Compile Time and Load Time address Binding](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/difference-between-compile-time-and-load-time-address-binding/)<br>
Penjelasan terkait perbedaan antara address binding tipe compile time dengan load time.

3. [Address space](https://www.ibm.com/docs/en/zos-basic-skills?topic=storage-what-is-address-space)<br>
The range of virtual addresses that the operating system assigns to a user or separately running program is called an address space.
This is the area of contiguous virtual addresses available for executing instructions and storing data

4. [Dynamic & Static Linking](https://cs-fundamentals.com/tech-interview/c/difference-between-static-and-dynamic-linking)<br>
Linking is the process of bringing external programs together required by the one we write for its successful execution.
Static and dynamic linking are two processes of collecting and combining multiple object files in order to create a single executable.
Here we will discuss the difference between them.

5. [More about Dynamic & Static Linking](https://cs-fundamentals.com/c-programming/static-and-dynamic-linking-in-c.php)<br>
Linker is system software which plays crucial role in software development because it enables separate compilation.
Instead of organizing a large application as one monolithic source file, you can decompose it into smaller, more manageable
chunks that can be modified and compiled separately. When you change one of the modules, you simply recompile it
and re-link the application, without recompiling the other source files.

### W05
1. [Page-Buffering Algorithms](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/operating_system/os_virtual_memory.htm)<br>
A computer can address more memory than the amount physically installed on the system.
This extra memory is actually called virtual memory and it is a section of a hard disk that's set up to emulate the computer's RAM.

2. [Allocation of Frames](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/operating-system-allocation-frames/)<br>
Frame allocation algorithms are used if you have multiple processes; it helps decide how many frames to allocate to each process.
